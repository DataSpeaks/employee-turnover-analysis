# Employee Turnover Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes employee data to predict turnover using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify high-risk employees, understand drivers of attrition, and provide actionable recommendations to improve retention.

The analysis focuses on key factors such as:
- Employee satisfaction
- Workload (monthly hours and number of projects)
- Performance evaluations
- Tenure
- Promotion history

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is provided by **Coursera’s Employee Turnover dataset** for the purpose of completing their Advanced Google Data Analytics course.  
It has been anonymized and cleaned for analysis.  

*Note: The dataset is not included in this repository if it exceeds GitHub’s file size limits.*


## Key Insights
- **Low satisfaction** is the strongest predictor of turnover.  
- **Overwork** (high monthly hours and multiple projects) significantly increases attrition risk.  
- **Mid-level satisfaction** can indicate “ambivalent” employees who may leave if career growth is blocked.  
- **High-performing, high-satisfaction employees** may leave due to burnout or lack of promotions.  

## Actionable Recommendations
- Implement workload caps (e.g., ≤240 hours/month).  
- Identify and engage high-risk employees proactively.  
- Redesign promotion processes to be merit-based and transparent.  
- Monitor departmental attrition, focusing on high-risk areas like HR, Technical, Accounting, and Support.  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: exploratory data analysis, visualizations, modeling  
- **GitHub**: version control and portfolio hosting
